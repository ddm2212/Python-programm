# This Operator we generally used for the to performed bit operation like '1', '0'
a=10
b=20
# we Genrally perform  "and ,or,xnor " Operation When comes to binary i.e, " & ,|,^ "
print("Binary Of a is :"+bin(a))   # This Will print Binary Of the a
print("Binary Of b is :"+bin(b))   # This Will Print Bianry Of the b

# Now We Perofm  & ,|,^ operation
print(" "+bin(a))
print(bin(b))

print(a&b)
print(a|b)
print(a^b)
